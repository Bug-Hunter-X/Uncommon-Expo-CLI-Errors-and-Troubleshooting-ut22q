The solution often involves carefully examining the `package.json`, `package-lock.json` (npm), or `yarn.lock` (yarn) files.  Look for any conflicting or outdated dependencies. Reinstalling dependencies (`npm install` or `yarn install`) after cleaning the cache (`expo start --clear`) usually resolves the problem.

If reinstalling dependencies fails, consider deleting the lock file and reinstalling, forcing a fresh resolution of dependencies: 

npm install --force

//or 

yarn install --force

In rare cases, it may be necessary to completely delete your `node_modules` folder and the lock files, then re-install everything.  Be sure to commit your changes to source control before doing so.  

If the problem persists, checking the Expo Go app version and updating it if necessary might be helpful. Finally, verify that your Expo CLI is up-to-date (`expo update`) and consider raising an issue in the Expo forums or GitHub.
